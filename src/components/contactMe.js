            <p>I have been fortunate to have a few great mentors to guide me on this journey.
            This blog is my attempt to try and pay it forward. Between my career goals, my passion projects, being a husband and father.
            I am fairly busy, but I am always looking for opportunities to learn and help others.
            </p>
            <p>I am available for custom software development, but for the time being it must be mostly remote as I do have a day job.
             My primary area of expertise is C# and software architecture, but I am proficent in Agile methodologies, and unit testing.
             I am willing to pair program for learning and fun.</p>
